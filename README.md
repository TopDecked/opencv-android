# OpenCV Java project for Android

The OpenCV library for Android as Gradle project.

All credit goes to http://opencv.org/ I've took their library and exported it as `.aar` library. Now you can easily use OpenCV in a Gradle / Android Studio project.

## Usage Maven Repo

I've uploaded the `.aar` in my maven repository. You only need to add following lines to your `build.gradle` to add the dependency:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "http://dl.bintray.com/andmar1x/maven"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.opencv:opencv-android:3.2.0'
}
```
